# Project Summary
Collected Taiwan's dynamic and static public data, used machine learning to predict Taiwan's air quality (PM2.5), and identified key influencing factors through correlation analysis.

# Approach
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing: Clean, transform and organize original data to ensure data quality and usability
- Split the data into 80% training set and 20% test set
- PM2.5 model training (RF, MLP, GRU and LSTM)
- Use RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as an indicator to evaluate learning effectiveness
- Pearson correlation coefficient analysis: Evaluates the degree of linear correlation between two continuous variables
